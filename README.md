## About

There have been more stories popping up about ufo's lately and there are so many questions that could be asked on this topic?  This data analysis is going to look at two data sets to see if there are any relationships between where ufo sightings occur and the climate of those areas. This project will break the climate down to the average year round temperature of the fifty US states. The data will be analyzed in a Jupyter Notebook using Visual Studio Code as a text editor.  There is a requirements.txt file that provides all the necessary packages needed to edit and run the program.

## Question to answer

    * Is there any relationship between the temperature of an area and the amount of ufo sightings that are reported in those areas?
    
    
## Features
    
    * Read in two sets of data with Pandas
    * Join the dataframes using Pandas concat
    * Create SQL table with the dataframe
    * Create visualizations using Seaborn
    * Data dictionary
    * Annotate

## Run the Program

    * source venv/Scripts/activate - Virtual Environment activation
    * pip freeze requirements.txt - list of the packages installed
    * open notebook
    * run the programs
    * edit if necessary

## Conclusion

Based on the data that was collected there does not appear to be any specific connection between temperature of an area and the amount of ufo sightings that are reported. The graphs seem to go up and down and there is not a noticable trend. There would need to be more data to get a better analysis of this topic.
